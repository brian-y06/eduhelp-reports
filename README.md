#EduHelp Reports
EduHelp Reports is a SaaS I’m building for gdevapps.com (78M+ Downloads Across Product Line). When I was 17 years old, I wanted to learn to code and I wanted to start a business — and that’s what I’ve been doing since. To date, the project is 2000 hours in development. Although I can't share my entire codebase, I wrote a Medium Article to explain the project and my work style. I've included some longer code in this repo to show my coding style.
